## Gravelamps Review Materials

The folders contained here are those used by the Code Review process demonstrating the functionality of each of the functions and classes defined within Gravelamps, also contained within here is a flowchart showing the more detailed procession through the functions as undertaken by the Gravelamps Inference scripts. This allows any user to demonstrate for themselves that the functions are working as expected and gain better insight into how Gravelamps works. If you spot any errors in these scripts, please feel free to open issues. 

Each of the folders contains a single script with the same name as the folder that will run through the necessary files to test - with the exception of the lens generation testing which exists to create the plot files - in order to run this testing yourself, please either run the INIs through gravelamps_generate_lens_local or modify them with your own accounting tag in order to run them through gravelamps_generate_lens_pipe. 

Code Review was kindly undertaken by Suvodip Mukherjee
